// let a = 2 , b = 2 ;
// console.log(a + b) //addtion
// console.log(a - b) //subtraction
// console.log(a * b) //product
// console.log(a % b) //modulus (it return remender)
// console.log(a / b) //Division
// console.log(a ** b)// a isto the power b 

// console.log(2 + 2) 

//These are opeartion which we can perform in js these are called arithmetic oprations a and b are oprants and + , - ,* % , / , ** these all are oprator 

//we can also able join two string with the help of "+" 
let str1 = "vinayak";
let str2 = " kumar";
let str3 = str1 + str2;
console.log(str3); // it will print vinayak kumar we can also use concat method for this 

//But there is also some more confusing opration like this
console.log("1" + 2); // it will print 12 
console.log(2 + "1"); // it will also print 21 
console.log("1" + 2 + 2 ); // it will print 122 
console.log("1" + (2 + 2)); // it will print 14 because of ()
console.log(2 + 2 + "1"); // it will also print 41 
// let me explian you in simple what going on here see if the first oprant is number like in (2 + "1") it will 2 will convert into string and print 21 but the first oprant is string it will also do same even there oprantor in other like this one console.log("1" + 2 + 2 ) it will print 122 but if the first oprant is number like this one console.log(2 + 2 + "1") so it will add 2 + 2 = 4 then convert it in string so it will return 41 

hmm
