// let take a example that we need to store data of an register person on ower website in simple words a persons want to loginin ower website so we do need to store data some where for that we use varibales
// variable are like container which we use to store the data.
// There are four type of declaration in js for varaible.
const password = "5869";  //const value can not be change or redefine 
let name = "vinayak"; //we use let in newer version of code in js 
var email = "vinayak@gmail.com"; //we avoid to use var becuz of its block scope problem js 
city = "delhi"; // we can also define variable like this but it is a wrong practice for defining 

console.log(password); //we can print like this but in my case i have 4 variable we can only print one varaible by console.log so we use 
console.table([password , name, email, city ]); // for priting one and more than one varaible we use table for that
